;; Your application needs to open a web browser and
;; send the user to last.fm/api/auth with your API
;; key and auth token as parameters. Use an HTTP GET
;; request. Your request will look like this:

;; http://www.last.fm/api/auth/?api_key=xxxxxxxxxxx&token=xxxxxxxx
;; If the user is not logged in to Last.fm, they will be
;; redirected to the login page before being asked to grant
;; your application permission to use their account. On this
;; page they will see the name of your application, along with
;; the application description and logo as supplied in Section 1.
;; Once the user has granted your application permission to use
;; their account, the browser-based process is over and the user
;; is asked to close their browser and return to your application.
